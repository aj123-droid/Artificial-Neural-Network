# Artificial-Neural-Network
This program takes in readings from the Arduino App(its Serial reader that receives continuous Inputs from an ECG sensor)
as a CSV file and inputs them through a trained ML model. The trained feed-forward model then uses this input data to determine whether
 a patient has Arrythmia or not.
